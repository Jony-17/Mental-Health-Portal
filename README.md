## Mental Health Portal
I developed a website in the area of mental health, as a final course project. Its objective was to allow college students to learn about and mitigate the lack of knowledge about the importance of mental health today. It is important to highlight that this project gave rise to the opportunity to write a scientific article. The project used technologies such as:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - PHP
 - Python
